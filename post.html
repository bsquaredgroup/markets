                        <p>The retail sector in New Zealand is becoming increasingly pessimistic, as more than half of the surveyed retailers missed their Q1 sales targets. This seems to be driven by factors such as local food prices rising by 2.1% in March and an impressive 12.1% year on year. Credit demand has dipped by 6.2% YoY, marking the lowest level since the first COVID lockdown. Mortgage demand has also experienced a steep drop of 20% compared to last year, which is hardly surprising given the current economic climate.</p>
                        <p>Monetary policy appears to be hindering the economy, and it seems that more hikes and pain are on the way. As a result, New Zealand may be set for the classic boom-bust cycle, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand potentially overreacting in its policy response.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, US interest rates continue to rise, taking the US dollar along with it due to solid economic data. The Empire State Manufacturing Index soared 10.8 points, while new orders jumped 46 points to 25.1. The NAHB Homebuilder Index also increased for the fourth consecutive month to 45. Consequently, the 2-year Treasury yield rose 9 basis points to 4.19%, while the 10-year yield increased 8 basis points to 3.59%. The market is now pricing a 22 basis point rate hike for the May FOMC meeting, and expectations for rate cuts in the second half of 2023 are fading.</p>
                        <p>The New Zealand economy seems to be sinking faster, with ASB Bank predicting a 2% GDP contraction. It remains unclear whether this decline is driving the Kiwi currency's underperformance or if the current account deficit is finally taking its toll. The 200-day moving average sits at 0.6160, and a break below this level could open up further downside. NZD/AUD is finally providing some relief to exporters, trading at the bottom of the 92-94 cents range.</p>
                        <p>In the equity markets, the DOW gained 100 points, the Nasdaq rose 34 points, the NZX increased by 56 points, and the ASX went up by 15 points. In the commodity markets, WTI crude oil traded at $81, carbon was priced at $61.75, and Bitcoin hovered around $29.4k.</p>
                        <p>Federal Reserve official Barkin commented, "I want to see more evidence that inflation is settling back to target." On today's economic calendar, we have the release of the REINZ report, which might reveal another disappointing month. Additionally, we'll be watching China's activity data and the US Housing Starts and Permits figures.</p>
