                        <p>The New Zealand Dollar (Kiwi) is under pressure and has fallen overnight across all currency pairs, with NZDEUR reaching a 3-year low. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) potential intention to push the economy into a recession could be a reason behind this decline. However, if RBNZ Governor Orr aims to combat inflation, a weaker NZD would actually contribute to increased imported inflation. The situation might be excessive, but exporters are taking advantage of it.</p>
                        <p>The US Dollar is weaker while equities are mostly up, although technology stocks are having a hard time. US Treasury yields are rising ahead of tonight's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, with the 2-year yield up 4 basis points to 4.05% and the 10-year yield up 2 basis points to 3.44%. The Dow Jones is up by 98 points, Nasdaq down by 52 points, NZX up by 4 points, and ASX up by 93 points. Crude oil (WTI) is trading at $81.37, carbon at $59.25, and Bitcoin at 30.1k.</p>
                        <p>Bitcoin has dropped below $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, but it's still 50% below its all-time high. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced its global growth forecasts by 0.1% to 2.8% for 2023 and 3% for 2024.</p>
                        <p>Fed's new voter Goolsbee suggests that the Federal Reserve should be cautious about raising interest rates too much, while Williams leans towards a more hawkish stance, stating that one more rate hike is a reasonable starting point.</p>
                        <p>China's credit growth is stronger than anticipated, with a 5,380 billion increase in March. Consumer inflation in the country has hit an 18-month low as factory gate prices declines have accelerated.</p>
                        <p>Australian housing prices might have reached a turning point, as they have increased by 2% since February. New Zealand usually lags behind Australia by 3-6 months. Meanwhile, New Zealand's QV housing prices have dropped by an average of 3.9% since the beginning of the year.</p>
                        <p>Warren Buffet is considering more investments in Japan. As for tonight, the US CPI is expected to be +0.4% month-over-month and +5.6% year-over-year.</p>
